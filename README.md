# v0 for HTML emails
Start HTML emails quickly and easily


### Hacking
It's probably a good idea to branch or download this repo and use a template as a starting point. You can write the styles in-line, or in the `<head>` and use a CSS-to-HTML inliner.

**Important:**You should also insert all the legal stuff like unsubscribe links, address, etc. The default templates include these by way of [Mailchimp's Merge Tags](http://templates.mailchimp.com/getting-started/merge-tags/)
